Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

I think version control is great for tracking your changes and making sure your changes are backed up in case anything happens to your local hard drive.

The biggest source of confusion for me so far is merge conflicts and resolving them the simplest way possible. For straightforward one-line examples it is
easily understandable but I can imagine how confusing it would get for complicated conflicts across many lines of code.
